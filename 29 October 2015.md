## Overslept
* Over slept from 6:00 to 12:00.
* I had a single chair on the entire floor but the thought of sitting in that chair forever was kind of tiring.
* Maybe i should just aim for 3 days deprivation first and then aim to adapt on single chair.
* It was scary how i turned off all the alarms. The pull to go back to sleep is so strong it's as if alarms don't even matter.
* Should be careful with multiple days deprivation. Have to put all the chairs completeley out of reach.

## Productivity
* Figured out how to use keras by y' trick
* Did two transistor led flasher \m/
* Managed to sleep on one chair

## Plan
* Write part 1 feedforward code, then recording, then gradient code.
* Feedforward-> Randomly initialize weights, select maximum likely action, act on that, get new set of observations x', reward
* If termnial action set y=reward else
* Recording-> Calculate phi(concat past 4 preprocessed frames + past 4 actions ?)
* Gradient descent ->
