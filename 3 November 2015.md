## Overslept a lot 10 hours
* Slept a long nap from 4:00-14:00.
* Should use the full suite of alarms to ensure this doesn't happen. If you sleep too much on the chair it can lead to backache which will cause you to move to the bed after 3-4 days.
* Another problem seems to be that i have set no goals. As such after 2-3 days the motivation to do sleep reduces. Should just focus on getting through 7 days: 3 + 3+ 1 and see what happens.
* Should start doing yoga, specifically chakrasan for fixing back issues. That's how every zone nap should end.

## Productivity
* Find out predict bug. Apparently you have to do the predictions in a batch which kind of makes sense.
* Modafinil. Biohacks ftw!
* Spragunr transition table. Been a strangely productive day.

## Plan
* Coffee/Modalert + Exercise + Mental math = zone
* complete code in zone. Fix the feedforward code, then start logging into table every k transactions.
* We can see nathan's launch options to further improve our code accuracy.

## Micrologs
* 14:00: Awake now.
* 16:00: Coffee + 5 Zone.
* 16:25: Coding for an hour. Next 3 zone at 17:25.
* 16:53: Work seems to be going well.
* 17:25: Taking a break. Have to figure out how did the guy store stuff in the transition table. Next coding sprint + 3 zone starts at 18:00.
* 19:45: Used modafilin.
* 20:45: Feeling perfectly awake. Amazing that this works. Now stack it and use it for naps. This should be the final piece of the puzzle.
* 22:19: Zone again (modafinil+coffee+exercise+5 zone).Working on understanding representation of transition table. High level of concentration and unusual clarity. Figured out the circular buffer issue.
* 23:10: Chilling for 50 minutes. Then some more mental math problems and working.
