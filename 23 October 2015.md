## Over reliance is dangerous, rigor is needed
* Slept off from 12:00 to 10:00. Seems that this always haapens whenever i just rely on one method.
* Single chair method isn't a good one because it causes back issues, remove it from summary.
* Bring back and retry the water bowl. 
* Night naps as the riskiest one. Don't start dota 2 until 11.
* Keep everything prepared BEFORE the nap.

## Productivity
* Worked out the theory from scratch.
* Started electronics and built some simple stuff.
* Azure gpu

## Plan
* Figure out how he uses phi, give it one last careful read, work out the theory n pseudocode on paper yourself.
* FInish the damn thing and start reading the code.
* Bring back rigor by trying out the complete 

## Micrologs
* 10:26: Drinking coffee and getting into the zone. Will work out the theory next.
* 11:38: Into the zone, can't believe it took one hour. Must have been really sleep deprived, time to work on theory n pseudocode. Will extend zone at 12:38 so don't forget to do it.
* 12:23: Seems to be going well. By using pen and paper and drawing diagrams n following rigor, i am clearing up a lot of misconceptions. For eg i learnt that the whole algo is just training enforcing a constraint of choosing the maximum value Q in a decision tree with randomly initialized weights. Seems this day will be productive after all.
* 12:35: Taking a break n doing timepass. WIll restart after getting into the zone. Had lunch as well.
* 1:05: Zone again. Trying out the neural network part now.
* 2:01: Battery came. Trying out some basic electronics tests.
* 4:04: Ok that was a lot of fun. Will do the rest of reading up on transistors in the night. Back to neural nets for now.
* 4:50: 5 questions Zone again.
* 5:29: Had to go on a trip with dad. Time wasted but it's okay.
* 6:15: Full zone again. Feeling great. One of the key things about zone is not to place constraint on youself on how many problems to do and go with the flow. You'll know yourself when you are ready.
* 7:01: Alright! understood theory. Now on to pseudocode and implementation. Giggity Giggity Goo! Zone is awesome!
* 9:03: Woah two hours just gone by like that. All right i'll start with the algo at 10:00. Should prepare coffee and everything else around 9:45. Time to do some electronics!
