* Machine learning for radiology

* Enlithic has raised $10 million. Seems to be a good application of machine learning. Simple as well.

* It's better if the startup idea you pick is simple to implement as well. http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/27/deep-learning-startup-enlitic-raises-10m-from-radiology-company-capitol-health/

* Input: X rays, MRIs, 

* See some videos on medical imaging

* Lots of funding activity in this space. Can use prebuilt convolutional networks to work with image data.

* Datasets: LIDC
