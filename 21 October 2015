# A bad day but i am still optimistic.

Today was a bad day. I overslept a lot today. I felt asleep around 12 hours which is horrible when you consider i have been averaging around 1-2 hours since Monday.

If you think about the reasons why i might have overslept too much, i think there might be several ones.

* I slept off around immediately after sleeping. This leads to a deeper sleep which makes waking up much more difficult.
* I set off just one alarm. Actually i think this is a problem with me that i tend to rely too much on one method like coffee etc and put my blind faith in it. I should be doing an ensemble of strategies to try out whatever works best.
* Moreover after oversleeping the first hour, i think everything is screwed anyways so let's just oversleep. This is especially bad for training your brain's networks. I need to provided my brain the reinforcement that optimizing the mean score is as much important as the daily minimum. I need to minimize the sum as well.
* I will try out the cold water bowl method as this should hypothetically ensure that i don't make any reflexive movements to turn off the alarm and take care of the water bowl properly. This should make it easier.
* I am doing logging (both subjective and objective decently). I just started subjective logging. This should increase my planning and reinforcement for my strategies.
* I will switch to using math alarms instead of normal alarms since it further reduces the chance of your unconscious brain kicking in and turning off the alarm
* I should probably use a checklist app which makes me check all of these before setting an alarm.

So writing an ensemble equation for the current model, it's something like this.

P(polyphasic_success) = P(coffee_before_after) * P(dota2) * P(multiple_distance_math_alarms) * P(ice_water_bowl) * P(logging) 

## Another note on productivity.

* This past week and this month in fact has been very bad in productivity, i haven't done much. I started playing a lot of dota 2.
* While playing dota 2 is unavoidable but in the earlier hours of morning while i am not very much sleep deprived, i should try to  max out the work done during the earlier hours.

## Plan for today
* Get into zone and read the deepmind paper and understand the theory completely. Use a pen and paper to work it out.
* Once you have understood it completely, then move on to writing a basic agent (v1) which just does actions randomly.
* Upgrade your basic agent to then use the randomly initialized weights in the neural network.
* Update the weights according to the reinforcement step. Keep collecting data on mean accuracy etc and plot it in realtime w.r.t time.
* Also start the cold water bowl method and karaoke as alternative acitivities for adaptation.
* Wash the dished :D

## What done?
* Read and understood part of the paper.
* Played dota 2
