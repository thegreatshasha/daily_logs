## Overslept a lot 10 hours
* Slept a long nap from 4:00-14:00.
* Should stick with the chair until i get the moving average for 7 days to 3.

## Productivity
* Ring buffer implementation.
* Ring buffer performance test.
* Quite productive day. Worked very hard today.

## Plan
* Coffee/Modalert + Exercise + Mental math = zone
* Play around with dequeue and use it for storing actions, rewards and images in the transition table
* Dequeue vs Circular Buffer performance test
* Find out if we are doing online learning/batch
* Calculate y and fit the training data
* Implement same metrics which nathan uses
* Keep track of score and moving average of score.See if it improves even slightly/
* If score improves, try using an ec2 instance and see how much it improves. If the best score is lesser than deepmind/nathan's implementation, start comparing parameter. Nathan's launch parameters are probably a good place to start.

## Micrologs
* 17:00: Modzone n working. Let' start with implementing the dequeue. Wonder how efficienct i
* 20:05: ALmost implemented ring buffer. Slightly tired so relaxing for half an hour.
* 11:49: Modafinil again. Let's see how long it takes to kick in after food. Can feel sleep disappearing already. Strange.
* 00:31: Can feel the affects
* 1:15: Exercise. Having coffee + getting into zone now in 10 mins. Then continuing work on ring buffer.
* 1:46: 3 zone. Exercise does help. Didn't have coffee. Let's see how productivity is. Resuming work on ring buffer.
* 1:52: How to get index?
* 3:58: Ring buffer performance test is complete but strangely it seems to be performing worse than the deque implementation. Which is strange since i assumed it should be blazingly fast.
* 4:05: Had another modafinil. Let's see how long till it kicks in.
* 4:08: Feeling clearer already. Just might be able to sleep..
* 5:35: Ok having some more coffee and working on performance test in half an hour. Wish every other day was as productive as this :)
* 8:05: Trying to write a cython version to see how much faster it is. Just for fun :)
