## Over slept a lot
* Slept off from 4:00 to 12:00. Seems that i am relying on the zone too much and ignoring poly sleep.
* I didn't prepare coffee beforehand n same with water bowl. Coffee and cold water should be prepared during the noon. Nighttime is dangerous.
* The black chair should be moved outside since it causes worse sleep. Move it back in while working.

## Productivity
* Found a paper on residual gradient descent

## Plan
* Get into the zone. Figure out why the inner terms in gradient descent equation are not derivatives of weights.

## Micrologs
* 12:42: Freshening up, taking a walk and getting into the zone. Only have one slot right now so should go intensely on this.
* 13:50: Partial zone can work with this i guess. Maybe i should switch to momonix for bigger problems instead of similar ones.
* 2:22: Woot! Found out that the error derivative issue is actually a real thing and the generalized algo is something else called residual gradient descent. Reading manga for 20 minutes. Attempting zone again at 2:45.
* 2:45: Having lunch.
* 3:48: Partial zone. Would need 1-2 more problems for complete zone but dont have that much time right now.Back to reading paper.
* 4:05: Get ready.
