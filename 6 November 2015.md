## Perfect sleep inspite of sleeping on bed
* Slept perfectly. Modafinil + Coffee + 3 alarms combo was good since moda does not kick in immediately.
* Be sure to use coffee + moda since moda does not provide a spike.

## Productivity
* Ring buffer index implementation
* Theory: Little bit on recurrent networks + Nvidia talk on deep learning

## Plan
* Exercise + 5 zone
* Complete cython version: Naah no use. Have to finish the ai first.
* Retrigger zone and then code everything else.

## Micrologs
* 14:28: Oops overslept. Had moda at 4:00
* 15:51: Kind of 2 hours wasted in the whole gas ordeal. This is why i hate the whole religion thingy.
* 16:40: Starting zone. Finishing transition table + ring buffer.
* 18:52: K did a lot of research on the idea. Putting ideas on github and improving them continuously seems like a good idea. Dinner + zone at 19:45.
* 19:34: Sleep siesta + Gradient descnet
* 20:41: Had a salvador sleep siesta. Wierd that it makes you feel completely refreshed even though it lasts only a second. This should solve the after sleep. Wonder if these stack.
* 20:51: Working on slice indexing for ringbuffer
* 22:20: Yup coffee does accelerate your thinking. Have to do something abt this back issue though.
* 00:48: Perfect zone. Did 5 questions but took a lot of time. But did help me think a lot so it's totally worth it. Heart beat at 02:18.
* 02:17: Ok ring buffer implementation is complete. Now can move on to storing the actual images, actions etc and implementing gradient descent. Starting work in 40 mins. This schedule seems to be rather good. 1:30 hr of zone work + ~40 mins of chilling.
* 04:27: Oops chilled a lot more than expected. Bit tired by sitting for so long. Relaxing for an hour + going to sleep. Preparing via 3 alamrs + coffee + modafinil. Alarms will be kept spaced so that you have to walk over. Should work since am not very sleep deprived right now.
* 04:37: Have set an alarm + kept at height + coffee + moving away chair + moda next. Should be enough i guess.
* 05:38: Ok got up but coffee isn't so much effective. Can still feel a small bit of sleepiness. Guess the only option is moda now. Will try taking a whole pill. Setting alarm for 40 mins on height n popping moda BEFORE.
