* Predictions from satellite images http://orbitalinsight.com/. Deep learning for remote sensing?

* Semantic image search. Better image search technology

* Semantic video search seems promising: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./iyu/files/p_icmr15_ek0.pdf. One thing to consider is how well will this generalize to other like veoh, vimeo, 9gag. This is rather experimental and not very easy to do but can have big applications.

* Ayasdi + Deep learning? How useful is topological data analysis?

* Enlitic: Deep learning + radiology

* Advertising: How can deep learning help in that?

* What does alchemy API do?

* Thought vectors? How can they improve search. What to do with them? What about skip thought vectors: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06726v1.pdf

* Natural voice.
