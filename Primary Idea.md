# Cloud based smart cctv control 

# How is this smart
Multi actor identity recogniser(neural net) + Activity mapper(neural net) + Threat assesment(neural net). It can identify multiple actors in the scene + what activity each actor is doing.
Have a default threat level for each actor. Terrorists + People with prior criminal backgrounds
Raise threat levels through a combination of user's threat level

# Components
* Actor database: Have a databse of actors. Actors all have bayesian threat levels. Don't know if we need support for non human actors.
* Identity Recogniser: The identity recogniser tells the most likely match in the actor databse

# Applications
* Activity threat coupled with Actor history allows you to predict criminal 
* Detect key events like fighting, fire, tresspassing,  
* Government city wide surveillance.
* Airport threat assesment by comparison with existing terrorist databases.

# ThinkList
* Write this like a research paper.

* Have to compare with existing approaches.
* Find out which companies use cctv control rooms. Should be a good application.
* Add a unique identifier for each object detected like man#34591, dog#91231  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG7V7_zowZU

* If the identity mapper can further map identities
* Discuss this idea with profs etc.
* Does our actor recognizer work even in the night with infrared cameras?
* Turn on lights etc in the area, sound alarms
* Allow collecting with
