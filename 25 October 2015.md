## Overslept
* Slept off from 4:00 to 8:30 and then 10:00 to 11:20=6:50minutes. Not very good but ok. Have to optimize.

## Productivity

## Plan
* Get into the zone. Read the residual gradienr descent paper.
* Read the deepmind code and see how they do encoding. Start your own implementation based on that.

## Micrologs
* 12:01: Freshening up and prepare for zone.
* 13:12: In zone. Searching for ideas and researching on paper. Read paper till 2:33pm. Still need to figure out examples and clarify theory. Maybe making up some examples of my own will help.
* 14:33: Having lunch n chilling. Will continue zone n paper after lunch.
