## Overslept
* Slept off from 4:00 to 8:30 and then 10:00 to 11:20=6:50minutes. Not very good but ok. Have to optimize.
* 

## Productivity
* Read the residual gradient descent paper. Didn't understand it completely but should be an interesting thing to try out.

## Plan
* Get into the zone. Read the residual gradienr descent paper.
* Read the deepmind code and see how they do encoding. Start your own implementation based on that.

## Micrologs
* 12:01: Freshening up and prepare for zone.
* 13:12: In zone. Searching for ideas and researching on paper. Read paper till 2:33pm. Still need to figure out examples and clarify theory. Maybe making up some examples of my own will help.
* 14:33: Having lunch n chilling. Will continue zone n paper after lunch.
* 15:38: Rezone. It was easy this time since the effect seems to persist if you do the first iteration rigorously.
* 19:03: Slept off from 16:00 to 18:00. Feels refreshing but need to optimize.
* 19:55: Working but not very productive. Having dinner, reading code
* 22:46: This phase wasn't very productive. Need to zone in and then start working, even if it takes more time.
* 02:51: Yup tried starting reading code with zone again. Its 300% more effective. There's no need to work outside the zone at all. Rather you can try but it's just mostly staring at a screen without thinking anything.
