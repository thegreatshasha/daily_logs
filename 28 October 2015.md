## Overslept
* Over slept from 2:00 to 12:00. 10 hours :(
* Have to really remove these other chairs, they don't lead to better sleep but cause you to want to sleep more.
* Ok i'll move all chairs up and leave just one chair downstairs. Shouldn't be really hard to do with folding chairs.
* Other than that have got 4 alarms and tonnes of strong coffee.

## Productivity
* Quite productive. Got gui working with python.
* Started coding. Worked in a sprint for 3-4 hours so  that was pretty productive.
* Did some more coding in the night.

## Plan
* Practice zone for half an hour.
* Don't look at that guy's code, just look at the algorithm and write your own implementation. Should be much faster.
* Breakdown the problem into simpler 
* Write code to get maximum probability and select transition based on that. Do this over each episode and time series etc.
* Do phi to get concatenated vector of four prior frames.
* Start storing transitions and do gradient descent then.

## Micrologs
* 13:19: Awake now. Zone and starting work. Let's make this day hyperproductive!
* 17:04: Know what the issue is i think. TImed zone has been really useful for quick thinking. Productivity has been hyper today. Let's take half an hour break now.
* 21:28: Ok practice zone and am in partial zone again. Timed zone seems much more effective than untimed one because you can reach peak concentration much faster.
* 01:05: Coffee, zone and resume work. Have to finish this by Saturday. I was supposed to finish this last Saturday.
