## Perfect sleep inspite of sleeping on bed
* Slept perfectly. Modafinil + Coffee + 3 alarms combo was good since moda does not kick in immediately
* Let's continue the productivity streak, focus is the key.

## Productivity
* Cython implementaiton of ring buffer
* Theory: Little bit on recurrent networks + Nvidia talk on deep learning
* Ok just need to add indexes to circular buffer now.

## Plan
* Exercise + 5 zone
* Write a cython version of ring buffer for better performance and fun. Compare with older. Git tag releases.
* Complete cython version
* Retrigger zone and then code everything else.

## Micrologs
* 11:00: Up and running.
* 12:53: Coffee + Moda + Exercise + 5 problems. Lately i have been giving less weight to 5 problems and 7 problems when they are the primal constituent. The rest are just accelerants. Beginning work at 13:13. Next 5 problems at 14:00.
* 14:27: Let's just try to get a really really simple sample working.
* 15:17: Ok awesome cython wrapper works now. Now just need to write the efficient ring buffer class these two.
* 23:34: Ok am here. Did spend a lot of time talking to people but will be fixed now. Night is ours. Zone begins at 12:05.
* 01:00: Full zone begins. Lets have some fun!
* 01:51: Working on ring buffer. Attempting pushups, zone n attacking problem again at 2:22.
* 04:01: Working but effect of exercise kind of shorttime. Good for energy though.
* 04:48: Circular buffer seems to be performing better than deque. Seems like i might have been using the wrong tests. Just need to add indexing now in circular buffer and it's ready for usage.
* 04:49: Also have added shape functionality to circular buffer for better performance. Relaxing for half an hour and then continuing work on indexing.
