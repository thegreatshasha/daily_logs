# LIFO stack of papers i found interesting. Can be useful for startup ideas as well.

* Papers on describing videos using neural networks. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4729v3.pdf and http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.08029v5.pdf: and http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-180.pdf
* Face detection neural networks http://www.gizmag.com/face-detection-algorithm-yahoo/36145
* Noise removal from audio using neural networks http://www.andrewng.org/portfolio/recurrent-neural-networks-for-noise-reduction-in-robust-asr/. Can this be applied to images as well?
* Recurrent neural networks for better text to speech: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dnntts/
