### P(success) = P(coffee_before_after?) * P(dota2) * P(multiple_distance_x_y_math_alarms?) * P(ice_water?) * P(logging?)

I'll update this if i think of something else.

Giant List of Activities to do:

## Pool Of Activites
* Play dota 2 since it's so addicting.
* Write a blog, daily log/write about how you are feeling, anything.
* Cooking is good since it doesn't require much mental work.
* Fapping since it immediately distracts you from deprivation.
* Showering if nothing else works out. Be careful though since cold showers do drain willpower a lot leaving you vulnerable for the successive adaptation.
* Swing two badminton rackets and pretending to be a dual sword master (woot!)
* Making more coffee in a mixer!
* Drawing. Haven't done this much in since i have started logging but i should start again.
* Electronics. Will start this once those idiots at kitn n spares actually ship my msp430.
* Singing. I'll try this app called sing karaoke.
* Exercise and pushups. Fairly obvious.
* Music: Try buying a keyboard

## Tips
* You'll never succeed if you don't follow your own method so Be rigororus.
* Keep everything prepared before the nap
* What's the use of poly sleep if you don't churn out as much as possible from everyday.
* Do micro logging so that you log everything. Log everything, your assumptions, when you waste time, when you step off from work experiences etc in an accessible structured format. 

## Schedule
* COffee n 5 mental math probs to get into the zone.
* Work for 3-4 hours with gaps of 10-15 mins.
* Switch to pool of activities around 1 hr before or earlier in the night.

I'll add more as i think of them.
