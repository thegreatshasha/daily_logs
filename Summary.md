I'll update this if i think of something else.

Giant List of Activities to do:

## Pool Of Activites
* Write a blog, daily log/write about how you are feeling, anything.
* Cooking is good since it doesn't require much mental work.
* Fapping since it immediately distracts you from deprivation.
* Showering if nothing else works out. Be careful though since cold showers do drain willpower a lot leaving you vulnerable for the successive adaptation.
* Swing two badminton rackets and pretending to be a dual sword master (woot!)
* Making more coffee in a mixer!
* Drawing. Haven't done this much in since i have started logging but i should start again.
* Electronics. Will start this once those idiots at kitn n spares actually ship my msp430.
* Singing. I'll try this app called sing karaoke.
* Exercise and pushups. Fairly obvious.
* Music: Try buying a keyboard

## Productivity
* Coffee seems to be directly correlated to maximum productivity.
* Full zone. Directly related to intensity. Have to experiment between timed vs untimed bigger calculations.

## Tips: Meditation + Math + Puzzles + Cold Showers
* You'll never succeed if you don't follow your own method. Be rigororus.
* You aren't really awake unless you do 5 math. So keep it as the first activity after waking up.
* Should solve puzzles everyday because they are good for the brain. Plus they develop curiosity and fascination + boost confidence.
* The whole point is to have fun. Play around, don't be too serious!
* Meditation daily for happiness. No point if you are not happy.
* Cold shower + Logging are good for rigor and should be the core around which everything else is centered.
* Mental math is the primal constituent of the zone. Rest are catalysts.
* Keep everything prepared before the nap
* What's the use of poly sleep if you don't churn out as much as possible from everyday.
* Do micro logging so that you log everything. Log everything, your assumptions, when you waste time, when you step off from work experiences etc in an accessible structured format.
* Use gitxiv for research papers. Start reading a lot of research papers.
* Keep learning mathematical theory everyday. Theory must never stop since it's the origin of everything. First half of the day should be on learning theory.
* If bored u can see videos on some unrelated science stuff.
* Try to improve on your project ideas everyday.
* Start zone by doing a 5 prob or 7 prob. Continue every 1:30 hour by using heartbeat n setting alarm. Calculations zone if more effective than any other supplement. It's worth it even if takes an hour or so.
* Music is good for both productivity and motivation so keep it playing.

## Adaptation Plan
* Stay awake for 36 hours. Till Monday 6:00 am: Do the majority of the coding here.
* After that nap every 2 hours for 24 hours: Till Wednesday, 6:00 am.
* After that nap every 4 hours: Starting from Thursday 6:00 am till Friday 6:00 am.
* Prepare ample coffe and modafinil to supplement whenever necessary. Friday 6:00 pm adaptation is finished.
* For sore butt, goto roof and do some yoga + meditation periodically
