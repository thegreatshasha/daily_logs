## Triphasic sleep
* Let's try out triphasic. If it doesn't work out we can always do  to http://napchart.com/brse3
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/polyphasic/NQznXOdkBCs
* Will be doing logging heavily + max alarms + coffee + moda(if groggy)
* Nap times are 6:00->07:30, 02:00->03:30, 22:00->23:00
* Will try this out for a week. If it doesn't work, try biphasic.
* Bring back coffee
* let's start researching on startup ideas daily
* Trying the cold shower for a week challenge
* keep building stuff and see how it goes!

## Daily Rituals
* Meditated
* Cold shower
* Puzzles

## Productivity
* Theory: Started coursera rnn. Should continue this everyday.

## Plan
* Exercise + 5 Mental math for zone. Prepare coffee beforehand.
* Clear out theory on pen and paper and compare it with nathan's implementation.

## Micrologs
* 04:00: Trying out 7 zone + finishing off
* 04:10: 7 zone. Trying out atari ai now. Working out the skip frame theory.
* 04:34: Going well, let's try to write a broken implementation v1 first without worrying too much about getting it working. Then explore some more, compare it with nathan's implementation and run it. If no improvements at all, we can make a list of things that do not match. Write pseudo code before if you are still too worried.
* 05:39: Ok seems to be going quite well. Writing pseudocode without worrying too much about the final seems to be helping.
* 17:07: Slept around 10 hours. Single alarm really doesn't seem to work. Need to put all 3 alarms + coffee. Resuming at 18:30.
* 11:30: Exercise + Zone + Work for 3 hours.
* 00:40: Coffee zone + work
* 01:14: Full zone. Seems that the trick is to do around 7 problems. I might have gone a little bit into 
* 02:13: Working on idea research. Seems to be going well. Into zone overdrive so that's a bit problematic.
* 03:40: THinking walks helps a lot. Cleared up many things. Don't need to readup on Nathan's implementation now.
