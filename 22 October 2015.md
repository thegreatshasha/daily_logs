## Slightly better but still not enough
* Slept in the morning from around 4:00 to 9:00
* This is a reduction from the previous day but still not enough. The previous two days had been much better when i averaged.
* Probably the reasons is it's still too easy to turn off the alarm.
* I gave up the water bowl method in the night since it seemed too annoying. Don't know how well it works.
* Maybe i need more coffe, and one more alarm clock. PC doesn't seem to count since it's too easy to turn off.
* Hanging all the alarms on a height seems to be a good idea.
* Easy access to coffee at all times.
* Just need to drink coffee immediately after getting up. This needs to be an instinctive reaction. Maybe i should apply something like pavlov's conditioning to drinking coffee to set a ritual after getting up which i do subconsciously.

## Productivity
* Have kind of understood the paper but still there are somethings i don't understand like the preprocessing stage.
* Time to checkout the code and see what preprocessing they have done actually. Other than that i have an intutive understanding of what to do.

## Plan for today
* Understand how the preprocessing is done, checkout a basic version of the code and try to understand what they are doing.
* Make notes on what they have done and start writing your own implementation in python.
* Start writing a blog post on it.
