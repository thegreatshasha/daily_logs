## Overslept
* Slept off from 4:00 to 11:00 7 hours.

## Productivity
* Got ale working, woot!
* Wrote a test ale python script. Time to move on to a real ai.

## Plan
* Get into the zone. Write the pseudocode and think about it. Start writing the code.

## Micrologs
* 11:50: Freshening up, walking around and zone.
* 13:58: Having lunch, watching stuff and rezoning after that with 4-5 problems. Have to write pseudocode after that.
* 16:00: Going to sleep. Will wake up in half an hour, coff n rezone properly and work.
* 19:44: Got ale working. Used partial zone but was still very productive. Productivity is directly correlated to depth of zone. Zone + coffee is awesome combo. Chilling + Eating for half an hour. Then getting back to work.
* 2:04: Wrote a test script in python! Now need to figure out the keras issue and the pseudocode.
