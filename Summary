P(polyphasic_success) = P(coffee_before_after?) * P(dota2) * P(multiple_distance_x_y_math_alarms?) * P(ice_water_bowl?) * P(logging?)

I'll update this if i think of something else.

Giant List of Activities to do:

* Play dota 2 since it's so addicting.
* Write a blog, daily log/write about how you are feeling, anything.
* Cooking is good since it doesn't require much mental work.
* Fapping since it immediately distracts you from deprivation.
* Showering if nothing else works out. Be careful though since cold showers do drain willpower a lot leaving you vulnerable for the successive adaptation.
* Swing two badminton rackets and pretending to be a dual sword master (woot!)
* Making more coffee in a mixer!
* Drawing. Haven't done this much in since i have started logging but i should start again.
* Electronics. Will start this once those idiots at kitn n spares actually ship my msp430.
* Singing. I'll try this app called sing karaoke.
* Exercise and pushups. Fairly obvious.

I'll add more as i think of them.
